# Contributing to Numerical Methods Toolkit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Numerical Methods Toolkit! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numerical-methods-toolkit.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add your meaningful commit message"`
7. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Create a Pull Request

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Write comprehensive comments for complex algorithms

### JavaScript Code
- Use ES6+ modern JavaScript features
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase)
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Use meaningful variable names

### HTML/CSS
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Use consistent class naming (BEM methodology preferred)

## Numerical Methods Guidelines

When adding new numerical methods:

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure mathematical correctness
2. **Stability**: Handle edge cases and numerical instability
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear explanations of the algorithm
4. **Visualization**: Include appropriate charts and graphs
5. **Real-world Application**: Connect to weather data analysis
6. **Testing**: Include test cases with known solutions

## Adding New Features

### New Numerical Methods
- Create a new Python module in the `backend/` directory
- Add corresponding frontend integration in `main.js`
- Include visualization components
- Update the methods array in JavaScript
- Add comprehensive documentation

### UI/UX Improvements
- Maintain consistency with existing design
- Ensure responsive design compatibility
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

### API Integrations
- Handle errors gracefully
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Add appropriate fallback mechanisms
- Document API usage and limitations

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test all numerical methods for accuracy
2. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. Validate HTML and CSS
5. Test with different weather data scenarios
6. Ensure no JavaScript errors in console

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add comments to complex code sections
- Include mathematical formulations for new algorithms
- Provide usage examples for new features
- Update the presentation roadmap if necessary

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs or issues:

1. Use a clear and descriptive title
2. Provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue
